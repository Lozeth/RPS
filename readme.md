# Rock–Paper–Scissors: Simple Step-by-Step Tasks

## 1. Decide what the game should do
Write down what you want the game to do:
“You choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, the computer chooses too, and the game tells you who wins.”

## 2. List the three possible choices
- Rock  
- Paper  
- Scissors  

## 3. Write down the rules of who beats who
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Paper beats Rock  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Same choice = tie  

## 4. Plan how the game will start
Decide what the game will say when it begins (like showing the rules).

## 5. Plan how the player picks an option
Think about how the game will ask the player:
“Do you want Rock, Paper, or Scissors?”
And how it will check that the player enters something valid.

## 6. Decide how the computer picks an option
The computer should choose randomly — like rolling a dice.

## 7. Plan how to compare both choices
- If both choices are the same → tie  
- If different → use your rules to decide the winner  

## 8. Plan what the game will tell the player
Examples:
- What the player chose  
- What the computer chose  
- Who won  
- Fun message (e.g., “You win!”)

## 9. Decide if the game repeats
Plan how the player can choose to play again (yes/no).

## 10. Plan what happens when the player stops
Usually something like:
“Thanks for playing!”
