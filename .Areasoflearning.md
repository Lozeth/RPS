How to add delay between messages?
Make text fancy for victory message, maybe appear in center?
How to make sure the case of their answer does not matter?
how do i use the get user choice command???
How to start over if user presses y
How to close the window if user presses n, preferably after a message that thanks the user for playing and then sits there for 2-3 seconds.
I will be asking y/n questions twice, is it as simple as making the response to the first and second questions different variables?
How do I set up the logic elegantly????? Obviously can go: If user = paper and computer = rock, winner=user. Is there a way to tell the code that paper>rock>scissors>paper and determine the winner through that logic?
When I have the codebase, how do I make it less messy?
For the results of the computer's choice, how do I get it to announce it's choice and state the winner of the game on separate lines?
How do I set up loops? when the game draws I want the user to be able to select a move straight away rather than having to start the program from scratch
If I have a mistake further down in the code, the entire program will not run, I want to test changes I make while still keeping incorrect code as a placeholder, is there a way to test what I think is correct without deleting what I know is wrong?
line 21 is not working. figure out why!
